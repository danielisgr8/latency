# latency
Check the latency to a server and synchronize `n` connections from server to client.

## Accessing the npm package
TBD

## Running the example
The `build` or `build-watch` scripts will compile the example JavaScript code. This must be run before serving/navigating to the example page.

The `start-serve` script serves the `example/client/public` folder. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/index.html` to access the example.

The `start-ping` script serves a simple ping server to `http://localhost:1234`. This server is used by the example app.
